> Collaborative Filtering(CF), a well-known approach in producing recommender systems,
has achieved wide use and excellent performance not only in research but also in industry.
However, problems related to cold start and data sparsity have caused CF to attract an
increasing amount of attention in eorts to solve these problems. Traditional approaches
adopt side information to extract eective latent factors but still have some room for
growth. Due to the strong characteristic of feature extraction in deep learning, many
researchers have employed it with CF to extract eective representations and to enhance its
performance in rating prediction. Based on this previous work, we propose a probabilistic
model that combines a stacked denoising autoencoder and a convolutional neural network
together with auxiliary side information (i.e, both from users and items) to extract users and
items' latent factors, respectively. Extensive experiments for four datasets demonstrate that
our proposed model outperforms other traditional approaches and deep learning models
making it state of the art.

### 3 aSDAE Model
![aSDAE model](https://github.com/daicoolb/PHDMF/blob/master/aSDAE.png)

This is a variant of ConvMF and aSDAE. Certainly, it is based on [ConvMF](http://dm.postech.ac.kr/~cartopy/ConvMF/) and [aSDAE](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/download/14676/13916).

We use aSDAE and CNN to generate the user latent factor and item latent factor, respectively.

If you want to use it, pleae install [keras](keras.io) and [tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/) ,respectively.

Note that this model can deal with three conditions: 
- only user side information (aSDAE model)
- only item side information (ConvMF model)
- user and item side information (PHD model)

Tipsï¼šPlease make sure you have a good deep learning environment to run these codes.
