# PHDMF
This is a variant of ConvMF and aSDAE. Certainly, it is based on [ConvMF](http://dm.postech.ac.kr/~cartopy/ConvMF/).

We use aSDAE and CNN to generate the user latent factor and item latent factor, respectively.

If you want to use it, pleae install [keras](keras.io) and [tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/) ,respectively.

Note that this model can deal with three conditions: 
- only user side information
- only item side information 
- user and item side information

Tipsï¼šPlease make sure you have a good deep learning environment to run these code.
